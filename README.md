# Thompson Sampling for Movie Recommendation

This README outlines the step-by-step roadmap to successfully complete the project "Bandits de Thompson" for identifying the most popular movie using Thompson Sampling. The project involves theoretical explanations, practical implementation, and analysis of results.

## **1. Theoretical Overview**

### **1.1 Explaining Thompson Sampling**
- **Objective**: Understand and explain the principle of Thompson Sampling.
- **Steps**:
  1. Define the multi-armed bandit problem:
     - Each arm represents a movie.
     - Rewards correspond to user feedback (e.g., like or dislike).
  2. Describe Thompson Sampling:
     - Use Bayesian inference to maintain a probability distribution over the reward probabilities of each movie.
     - Sample from these distributions to decide which movie to recommend.
  3. Provide an example:
     - Simplify with a two-arm scenario, e.g., comparing two movies based on user ratings.

### **1.2 Regret Bounds**
- **Objective**: Show how Thompson Sampling minimizes regret.
- **Steps**:
  1. Define regret in the context of the bandit problem (e.g., loss due to not always recommending the most popular movie).
  2. Briefly explain why Thompson Sampling achieves logarithmic regret (cite references if needed).
  3. Focus on an intuitive explanation rather than detailed proofs.

## **2. Practical Implementation**

### **2.1 Problem Formalization**
- **Objective**: Frame the movie recommendation problem as a multi-armed bandit task.
- **Steps**:
  1. Define movies as "arms" in the bandit problem.
  2. Assume binary user feedback:
     - 1 = Liked, 0 = Disliked.
  3. Goal: Identify the best movie (highest reward probability) with minimal user fatigue (i.e., fewest trials).

### **2.2 Setting Up the Environment**
- **Objective**: Prepare the data and tools for simulation.
- **Steps**:
  1. Choose a dataset:
     - Use MovieLens (simpler than Netflix).
     - Alternatively, create a synthetic dataset with a small number of movies (e.g., 10).
  2. Preprocess the data:
     - Extract movies.
     - Simulate user feedback using a Bernoulli distribution for each movie’s true reward probability.
  3. Install required Python libraries:
     - `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and optionally `scipy.stats`.

### **2.3 Implement Thompson Sampling**
- **Objective**: Develop and apply the Thompson Sampling algorithm.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Initialize priors** for each movie (arm):
     - Use Beta distributions: \( \text{Beta}(\alpha=1, \beta=1) \).
  2. **Iterative process**:
     - For each round:
       1. Sample \( \theta \) from \( \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta) \) for each movie.
       2. Select the movie with the highest sampled \( \theta \).
       3. Simulate user feedback (reward: 1 = Liked, 0 = Disliked).
       4. Update the Beta distribution for the selected movie:
          - \( \alpha = \alpha + \text{reward} \).
          - \( \beta = \beta + (1 - \text{reward}) \).
  3. Track metrics:
     - Cumulative regret.
     - Number of times each movie is selected.

### **2.4 Analyze and Visualize Results**
- **Objective**: Evaluate the performance of Thompson Sampling.
- **Steps**:
  1. Plot cumulative regret over iterations.
  2. Visualize the convergence of the probability distribution for each movie’s reward probability.
  3. Highlight how quickly the algorithm identifies the most popular movie.
  4. Compare results with a baseline (e.g., random sampling).
